# Week 3

## Day 1

_Question of the day:_ How would you write a program to make correct change (as in a cashier giving you coins, not changing the world)?

- Writing tests with pytest
- Exceptions

### Exercise

Pig Latin

### Assignment

Currency converter

**ERRATA:**

- `rates` is a list of tuples, not a dictionary.
- `from` is a reserved word, so use `original` or `_from` for the parameter indicating the currency to change from.
