# How to lay out a web page

1. Determine the objective of the page. 
2. Break out the elements of that page.
3. Rank each element of the page based on how closely it is aligned to the main purpose of the website.
4. Lay out those elements according to that rank.

# Design principles

---

# Clarity and simplicity

- Keep your design as simple as possible.
- Simple website designs are preferred by users
- Before adding a design element, ask if it makes the site clearer. If not, don't.

# Unified design

- Keep your design unified across the site.
- "People tend to view websites as one whole entity before seeing the individual elements (such as the logo, navigation, main CTA, body content, footer, etc.) that comprise the entire interface."[^1]

# Principle of least surprise

Place elements where users expect them.

---

# Colors and icons

- Use imagery and icons to communicate when possible.
- Color should be a design element, not decoration. Add colors to differentiate between elements. 

---

# Mobile

- The majority of web traffic now is mobile; you should plan on building responsively
- Responsive design has three parts
    - proportion-based grid
    - flexible-sized images
    - media queries via CSS (last and least important)
- Design for mobile; enhance for desktop
