# Week 1

## Day 1

_Question of the day:_ What does a developer do all day?

- Developer setup
- Command line basics (.bash_profile, cat, less, man)
- Git concepts and commands (clone, add, commit, push)
- VSCode

### How to learn

- Retrieval practice: quiz yourself
- Spaced, interleaved practice: do not work on the same problem for 5 hours. Take a break, take a walk, practice something else.
- Attempt to solve problems before being shown the solution: tackle things head-on, even if you don't know the answer
- Reflection: review what you've learned periodically and ask yourself questions
